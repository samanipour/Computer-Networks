# **Lab 0: Overview of Computer Network Basics & Making Ethernet Cables**  

## **Objective:**  
- Understand basic networking concepts.  
- Learn how to create Ethernet cables (Straight-Through & Crossover).  
- Get familiar with networking tools.  

## **Required Equipment:**  
- **Mikrotik hAP ac lite router**  
- **PC or Laptop**  
- **GNS3 installed on the system**  
- **RJ45 Connectors**  
- **Cat5e/Cat6 Ethernet Cables**  
- **Crimping Tool**  
- **Cable Tester**  
- **Wire Stripper**  

## **Step 1: Basic Networking Overview**  
1. **What is a Network?** - Explain networks, nodes, and interconnections.  
2. **Types of Networks** - LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN.  
3. **Networking Devices** - Router, Switch, Hub, Access Point.  
4. **IP Addressing Basics** - IPv4, IPv6, Subnetting.  

## **Step 2: Understanding Ethernet Cables**  
1. **Types of Ethernet Cables**  
   - Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a (Speed, Shielding, Performance).  
2. **Straight-Through vs. Crossover Cables**  
   - When to use each type?  
   - Standard T568A and T568B wiring.  

## **Step 3: Making Ethernet Cables**  
### **A. Cutting & Stripping the Cable**  
1. Take a **Cat5e/Cat6 cable** and cut it to the required length.  
2. Use a **wire stripper** to remove about **1.5 inches of the outer sheath**.  
3. Untwist the pairs and straighten them out.  

### **B. Arranging Wires According to Standards**  
1. **For Straight-Through Cable:**  
   - Follow **T568B** on both ends.  
   - Wire order: **Orange-White, Orange, Green-White, Blue, Blue-White, Green, Brown-White, Brown**.  

2. **For Crossover Cable:**  
   - One end follows **T568A**, the other follows **T568B**.  
   - T568A: **Green-White, Green, Orange-White, Blue, Blue-White, Orange, Brown-White, Brown**.  
   - T568B: **Orange-White, Orange, Green-White, Blue, Blue-White, Green, Brown-White, Brown**.  

### **C. Crimping the Connectors**  
1. Insert wires into the **RJ45 connector** in order.  
2. Push them firmly inside until they reach the end.  
3. Use a **crimping tool** to crimp the RJ45 connector.  

### **D. Testing the Cable**  
1. Use a **cable tester** to check continuity and proper wiring.  
2. If a cable fails the test, redo the crimping process.  

## **Step 4: Connecting Devices to the Network**  
1. Use the **Ethernet cable** to connect a **PC** to a **router or switch**.  
2. Verify the link using **LED indicators** on the network interface.  

## **Conclusion:**  
- You have successfully created an Ethernet cable.  
- You understand the basic concepts of networking.  
- You are ready to move to **Lab 1: Creating a Basic LAN Network**.
